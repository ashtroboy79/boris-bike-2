# Boris Bikes

London needs a network of bicycles and docking stations that people can use. This program will keep track of the network.

## Motivation

To help us learn good pair programming techniques, to test and debug our code with TDD, and build on our Ruby skills.

## Project Status

Ongoing: this is the current progress from day 3 with Ahsan and Suhani working through challenges 12-16.
